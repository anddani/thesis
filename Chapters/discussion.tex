% The benefit of fitting it all in cache.
% With radix 4, it is possible to fit all in cache?
% Preparations for this such as lining up data correctly.



%%%
% When is the fastest required performance-wise??

% Limitations of the NEON intrinsics. Only works for ARM

% Compare percentage speedup for iterative compared with recursive.

% As we see, choosing the correct FFT implementation can have a large impact.

% Discuss differences in performance large java times, small java times WHY?
