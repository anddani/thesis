\textit{To ensure that the experiment is carried out correctly, many different tools for measurements was evaluated. Different implementations of the FFT are also compared to choose the ones that would typically be used in an Android project.}
% Test how large the cost of JNI
% Debug/VMDebug libraries

% Preparation
% What tools are used? Phone, software, libraries (currenttimemillis vs nantotime etc),
% Different thread pools
% Measure execution time
% Measure memory consumption
% Benchmark Environment (Which phone, Android version, Compiler version, Java version, compiler flags)
% Benchmark Environment parameters (Started apps, memory left, started processes? cpu throttling by mobile case?)
% Profilers for time and memory measurement
% Disable Instant Run??
% Which operations should be included?
% Should I Measure every operation in detail?
