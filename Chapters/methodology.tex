\textit{To ensure that the experiment is carried out correctly, many different tools for measurements was evaluated. Different implementations of the FFT are also compared to choose the ones that would typically be used in an Android project.}
% Test how large the cost of JNI
% Debug/VMDebug libraries

% Preparation
% What tools are used? Phone, software, libraries (currenttimemillis vs nantotime etc),
% Different thread pools
% Measure execution time
% Measure memory consumption
% Benchmark Environment (Which phone, Android version, Compiler version, Java version, compiler flags)
% Benchmark Environment parameters (Started apps, memory left, started processes? cpu throttling by mobile case?)
% Profilers for time and memory measurement
% Disable Instant Run??
% Which operations should be included?
% Should I Measure every operation in detail?
% Garbage collection discussion (You cannot control it)
\section{Experiment model}

% http://lessthanoptimal.github.io/Java-Matrix-Benchmark/manual/MethodologyRuntimeBenchmark/
% In java, we cannot control GC, which can lead to varying results
% In java, do not use string concatenation (will ask for memory)
% Measure first, optimize later

% How will the results be represented?
% How will I interpret the results
% How many times will the programs be executed
% Statistical significance
% What is included in the calculation, what is not (adding result to string etc)
\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Data representation}
\subsection{Data interpretation}
\subsection{Statistical significance}

% Description of which algorithms that are available, which one that is used and why
% Detailed description/comparison between the code.
% Correctness test/verification??
% Complexity
% Test data: sizes of data, datatypes (long vs int vs float vs double)
